                  Commitment is the backbone of the Codify communityâ€”what you
                  put in is what you get out, both socially and technically.
                  Being consistent and dedicated to your workload is what helps
                  us amplify our collective impact.

                  Since Codify mainly works in the fast-paced world of tech
                  startups, we are looking for people who want to experience
                  building something impactful from the ground up.

                  Codify's first priority is the technical and professional

                  learning and improving on skills.
